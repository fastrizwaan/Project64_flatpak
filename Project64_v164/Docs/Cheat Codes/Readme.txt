I.   Introduction

Welcome to the Official Project64 Cheat Database.  This database contains a listing of
pre-formatted GameShark and Pro-Action Replay cheat codes for use with Project 64.  Due to
new developments in the cheat system of Project 64, the files accompanied with this file
will no longer be compatible with versions of PJ64 prior to v1.5 For personal notes from
the authors please read the appropriate files that come with this database.



II.   Installation
