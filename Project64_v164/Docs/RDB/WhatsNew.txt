ROMs that were not in 0997, are in 0999a, but had an assumed entry in the old RDB:
(i guessed the names right, so no change other than removing "not in GoodN64")
	Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (U)
	Pokemon Stadium 2 (F)
	Bomberman 64 - Arcade Edition (J)

ROMs that are not in GoodN64 0999a (Good Name is *assumed* as follows):

	[665F09DD-FC3BAC53-C:50]	Turok - Dinosaur Hunter (E) (V1.0) [b1] (previously "[a1]")


ROMs that are IMHO *probably* bad even though GoodN64 marks them [!]:

	Mission Impossible (F)	(hangs where it shouldn't)
	Nushi Zuri 64 (J)	(doesn't start)
